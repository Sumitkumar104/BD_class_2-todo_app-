it include 
1- Routes folder : In which we define our all routes (app.post("/eef", ),app.get("/edfrefrc", ) etc).  
2- Controller: In which we define our logics of backend tasks.
3- model: It contain stucture of files.
4- confrig: means it contain file with code which connect our server to database.
5- .env file: Environment file which contain port number,database URL etc which is used during the deployment . And Deployment always done 
   in  pipline (stage by stage). 

After that to reduce our effort to restart the server again and again we install nodemon ,it automatically restart the server after  changes in code .
To confrigue this we also change script in package.json file , we add ("dev":"Nodemon index.js") in script part .
